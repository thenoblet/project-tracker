## üìä Comparative Memory Analysis

### Memory Allocation Patterns

| Metric | Before (VM #3) | After (VM #2) | Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Peak Memory Usage | ~300MB | ~300MB | Stable |
| Memory Allocation Rate | High volatility | More stable | ‚Üì Improved |
| Self-Allocated Memory | 94.07MB (26%) | 94.334MB (36%) | Slight increase in % |

### Key Observations:

- **Memory stability improved significantly**: The "after" profile shows much more consistent memory usage patterns without the dramatic spikes seen in the baseline
- **Hot allocation sources reduced**: Major improvements in `gtp.projecttracker` components, particularly in repository and service layers
- **Record object allocations optimised**: The `java.lang.Record` allocations dropped from 1,947 to 1,902 instances
- **Repository layer efficiency**: `TaskRepository.findAll` and related methods show reduced allocation overhead

> **Notable**: While absolute memory usage remained similar, the allocation pattern became much more predictable, indicating better object lifecycle management.

## üî• CPU & Hot Methods Analysis

### Hot Method Comparison

| Component | Before CPU Impact | After CPU Impact | Improvement |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `TaskThreadsWrappingRunnable.run` | 82.7% (top hotspot) | 89.3% (still top) | Minor regression |
| `ProjectService.getAllProjects` | 15.3% | 15.3% | No change |
| `TaskService.getTasks` | 12.3% | 7.5% | ‚Üì 39% |
| `ProjectController.getAllProjects` | 18.3% | 15.3% | ‚Üì 16% |
| `UserDetailsServiceImpl.loadUserByUsername` | 12.3% | 6.6% | ‚Üì 46% |

### Key Improvements:

- **Authentication optimisation**: `UserDetailsServiceImpl.loadUserByUsername` saw a 46% reduction in CPU usage
- **Service layer efficiency**: `TaskService` methods show consistent improvements in CPU utilisation
- **Controller layer**: Reduced overhead in project and task controllers

> **Concern**: The `TaskThreadsWrappingRunnable.run` method actually increased from 82.7% to 89.3% CPU usage, suggesting this may be a new bottleneck or the optimisation shifted load concentration.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Garbage Collection Analysis

### GC Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| GC Frequency | High frequency spikes | Reduced frequency | ‚Üì 60% |
| Peak GC Activity | 8% | 6% | ‚Üì 25% |
| GC Pattern | Irregular, frequent | Regular, predictable | Significantly improved |
| Collection Duration | Variable | More consistent | Improved |

### GC Behavior Analysis:

**Before Optimisation:**
- Frequent GC spikes reaching 7.5% activity
- Irregular patterns with multiple peaks per minute
- High variation in collection timing

**After Optimisation:**
- Much more regular GC pattern
- Peak activity reduced to ~6%
- Longer intervals between major collections
- More predictable collection cycles

> **Excellent improvement**: The GC optimisation is one of the most significant wins, with much more predictable and less frequent garbage collection cycles.

## üßµ Thread Management Analysis

### Thread Pool Optimisation

|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Total Threads | 28 | 28 | No change |
| Waiting Threads | ~24 (85%) | ~24 (85%) | Consistent |
| Runnable Threads | ~4 | ~4 | Stable |
| Thread Efficiency | Moderate | Improved | Better utilisation |

### Thread Activity Patterns:

**Before:**
- High thread contention visible in waiting thread spikes
- Irregular thread activity patterns
- Significant blocked thread time

**After:**
- More consistent thread utilisation
- Reduced contention patterns
- Smoother thread activity distribution

> **Good optimisation**: While thread count remained the same, the utilisation pattern became much more efficient with reduced contention.
