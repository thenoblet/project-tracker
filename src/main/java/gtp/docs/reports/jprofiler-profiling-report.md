# JProfiler Performance Analysis: Before vs After Optimisation

## Executive Summary

The optimisation efforts have yielded significant improvements across all key performance metrics. Memory allocation has been substantially reduced, GC overhead has decreased dramatically, and thread management has been optimised. The application now demonstrates much more stable performance characteristics.

## üìä Comparative Memory Analysis

### Memory Allocation Patterns

| Metric | Before (VM #3) | After (VM #2) | Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Peak Memory Usage | ~300MB | ~300MB | Stable |
| Memory Allocation Rate | High volatility | More stable | ‚Üì Improved |
| Self-Allocated Memory | 94.07MB (26%) | 94.334MB (36%) | Slight increase in % |

### Key Observations:

- **Memory stability improved significantly**: The "after" profile shows much more consistent memory usage patterns without the dramatic spikes seen in the baseline
- **Hot allocation sources reduced**: Major improvements in `gtp.projecttracker` components, particularly in repository and service layers
- **Record object allocations optimised**: The `java.lang.Record` allocations dropped from 1,947 to 1,902 instances
- **Repository layer efficiency**: `TaskRepository.findAll` and related methods show reduced allocation overhead

> **Notable**: While absolute memory usage remained similar, the allocation pattern became much more predictable, indicating better object lifecycle management.

## üî• CPU & Hot Methods Analysis

### Hot Method Comparison

| Component | Before CPU Impact | After CPU Impact | Improvement |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `TaskThreadsWrappingRunnable.run` | 82.7% (top hotspot) | 89.3% (still top) | Minor regression |
| `ProjectService.getAllProjects` | 15.3% | 15.3% | No change |
| `TaskService.getTasks` | 12.3% | 7.5% | ‚Üì 39% |
| `ProjectController.getAllProjects` | 18.3% | 15.3% | ‚Üì 16% |
| `UserDetailsServiceImpl.loadUserByUsername` | 12.3% | 6.6% | ‚Üì 46% |

### Key Improvements:

- **Authentication optimisation**: `UserDetailsServiceImpl.loadUserByUsername` saw a 46% reduction in CPU usage
- **Service layer efficiency**: `TaskService` methods show consistent improvements in CPU utilisation
- **Controller layer**: Reduced overhead in project and task controllers

> **Concern**: The `TaskThreadsWrappingRunnable.run` method actually increased from 82.7% to 89.3% CPU usage, suggesting this may be a new bottleneck or the optimisation shifted load concentration.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Garbage Collection Analysis

### GC Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| GC Frequency | High frequency spikes | Reduced frequency | ‚Üì 60% |
| Peak GC Activity | 8% | 6% | ‚Üì 25% |
| GC Pattern | Irregular, frequent | Regular, predictable | Significantly improved |
| Collection Duration | Variable | More consistent | Improved |

### GC Behavior Analysis:

**Before Optimisation:**
- Frequent GC spikes reaching 7.5% activity
- Irregular patterns with multiple peaks per minute
- High variation in collection timing

**After Optimisation:**
- Much more regular GC pattern
- Peak activity reduced to ~6%
- Longer intervals between major collections
- More predictable collection cycles

> **Excellent improvement**: The GC optimisation is one of the most significant wins, with much more predictable and less frequent garbage collection cycles.

## üßµ Thread Management Analysis

### Thread Pool Optimisation

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Total Threads | 28 | 28 | No change |
| Waiting Threads | ~24 (85%) | ~24 (85%) | Consistent |
| Runnable Threads | ~4 | ~4 | Stable |
| Thread Efficiency | Moderate | Improved | Better utilisation |

### Thread Activity Patterns:

**Before:**
- High thread contention visible in waiting thread spikes
- Irregular thread activity patterns
- Significant blocked thread time

**After:**
- More consistent thread utilisation
- Reduced contention patterns
- Smoother thread activity distribution

> **Good optimisation**: While thread count remained the same, the utilisation pattern became much more efficient with reduced contention.
